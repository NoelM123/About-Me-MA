   <li> Here is a list of facts about me and my interests:
   <br> I have two dads and one twin brother, Ethan, we were both
    born on the 29th of December 2009. A lot of my family is
    chosen and most of the people who are related to us we 
    haven’t really known until recently. Ethan is currently
    going to the same school as me but we don’t have many 
    classes together because we’d probably get tired of each
    other quickly.
    </li>
</ul>

<ul>
   <li>I’ve known one of my friends since elementary school and 
    have known another one since 6th grade. I’ve basically 
    been with these friends since middle school and even a 
    bit before middle school.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
   <li>I’m currently going to Eastside Prep School; many kids 
    went there in 5th grade, but I joined in 6th grade.
    It’s a really nice school experience but its across 
    the 520 bridge which can make driving there and back 
    a risk for traffic.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
   <li>I’m interested in music and film making.
    I started piano because I just wanted something to do,
    I’m not good at it though, but I like film because I grew 
    up with a lot of movies and television in my life.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
   <li>I’m not sure what I want to be when I grow up, but I really 
    just want a stable job that isn’t very monotonous. I wouldn’t
    want to do a monotonous job because school has already been 
    like that for many years. Going through school I think ill
    be able to find and interest that can be a job.</li>
